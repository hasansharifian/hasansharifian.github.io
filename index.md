**MohammadHasan (Hasan) Sharifian**  
PhD Candidate in Social Psychology, University of Michigan

I am a PhD candidate in social psychology at the University of Michigan. My research examines the interaction between culture and group processes, with a primary focus on the Middle East. In cultural psychology, I study cognitive styles, emotion expression, and self-enhancement motivation in Middle Eastern populations, often in comparison with Western and East Asian samples. In the domain of group processes and intergroup relations, I investigate how cultural values such as honor and interdependence shape intergroup conflict.

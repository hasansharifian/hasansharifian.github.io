        <h3>Cognitive Styles and Framework Generalization</h3>
        <p>
          A central framework in cultural psychology contrasts analytic and holistic cognition, largely derived from East Asian–Western comparisons. In this project, I examine how well this framework generalizes across additional cultural contexts using experimental tasks that tap visual attention, judgment of change, causal attribution, syllogistic reasoning, and item categorization. The aim is to assess when the analytic–holistic distinction extends beyond the West-East cultural boundaries.

        <h3>The Interdependence of Honor</h3>
        <p>
          Honor is often described as simultaneously tied to personal self-worth and social standing, yet its psychological structure remains ambiguous. In this project, I investigate whether honor is more readily associated with individualistic or collectivistic representations across cultures. Using an Implicit Association Test (IAT) design, I examine implicit links between honor and individual versus collective concepts, and explore how these associations vary across cultural contexts.

        <h3>Honor, Ideology, and Prejudice</h3>
        <p>
          Research on prejudice typically emphasizes sociopolitical orientations such as right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. This project examines whether honor values are distinct from and explain prejudice beyond these established predictors. I study prejudice toward multiple target groups and assess how honor relates to, overlaps with, or diverges from broader ideological orientations.

        <h3>Cultural Variation in Conflict Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Many models of intergroup conflict treat escalation as primarily instrumental, predicting that hostility should track material power and expected outcomes. In this project, I examine whether cultures differ in the extent to which conflict behavior reflects instrumental versus reputational considerations. I analyze these patterns using both historical interstate dispute data and large-scale behavioral data from an online competitive videogame environment.
